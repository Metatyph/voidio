# Welcome to Void.io!

Void is an artificial intelligence fitted into the Atom text editor. It can automatically correct errorneous code as well as generate whole blocks of the stuff for various purposes. It also learns along the way using Deep Learning, which in theory means it would never be obsolete. In short, it is a tool made to help programmers program more easily and efficiently. 

## Or at least, it would be... 

...But sadly, Void is merely an imaginary product made up by four university students for their class. We didn't make Void yet - not even in principle - and maybe we never will. But I think it's a cool idea. And who knows? Maybe someone out there would somehow make this random fever dream project a reality. 

## The resources used for this website... 

Because my absolutely clueless self sure as hell didn't do all this without a ton of help.

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/): A really good framework for HTML, CSS, and JS. 

[Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/): A one-page Bootstrap theme I barely changed around and used.
